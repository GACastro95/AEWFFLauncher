# AEW Fight Forever Launcher

This is just a launcher that enables you to select between launching the game in a vanilla instance or a modded instance. This has the mod bypass built as a DLL (source code of this can be found here https://github.com/GACastro95/AEW-FF-Mod-Bypass/tree/DLL) so you no longer need to put any files in the game's binaries folder.

# First Time Setup
1. Launch the program
2. Navigate to the setup window
3. Set the folder to the root game directory of AEW Fight Forever, this is normally under ``/steamapps/common/AEWFightForever``. If you have your modded version of the game installed seperately from the vanilla version you can set this here as well.
4. Launch the game either as a vanilla instance or a modded instance.
